            <p>Since this is an app that's primarily based around long time use, 
                the Insights Page isn't able to be properly loaded in since we would need to show long term functionality, which
                given the scope of the class and the time we had to finish the project, it was not feasible. 
                <br>
                However, this is a peek into what it would look like given time!
